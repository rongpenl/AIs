Write a self-contained HTML file that, when opened in any modern browser, uses a JavaScript drawing library (e.g. p5.js) to animate a “double-pendulum” style system:

An inner rod, anchored at the canvas center, rotating at 0.5 revolutions per second.

An outer rod, pivoted at the tip of the inner rod, rotating at π×0.5 revolutions per second relative to that tip.

Continuously draw a smooth, persistent trail of the outer tip’s motion.

Ensure the page includes whatever CDN or script tags are needed so that it runs without any additional setup.

Keep the code concise and natural.
