<instruction>
Create a complete HTML page using p5.js that animates a two-rod system like a double pendulum:

- An inner rod rotates around the canvas center at 0.5 revolutions per second.
- An outer rod rotates around the tip of the inner rod at 0.5×π revolutions per second.
- Trace the motion of the outermost tip with a smooth, continuous trail.
- Use WEBGL if needed for clean rotation and smooth animation.

Include all necessary script tags (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.6.0/p5.min.js）so the file runs standalone.

Return the full HTML code inside <html>…</html>.
