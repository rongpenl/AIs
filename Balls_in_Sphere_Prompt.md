<instruction>
Create a full HTML page using p5.js that shows 100 bright yellow balls bouncing inside a transparent rotating 3D sphere.

- The sphere rotates slowly.
- Balls move in 3D with random initial velocities.
- Balls bounce off the inner surface of the sphere.
- Balls also bounce off each other using elastic collisions.
- Use WEBGL mode and make sure the balls never leave the sphere.
- Return a single standalone HTML file with all required code.

Keep the code clean and modular. Use object-oriented design where appropriate.
