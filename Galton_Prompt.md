I need to build a single page web application that utilizes p5.js and matter.js to demonstrate the idea of Galton board. More importantly, the app enables users to change the physical parameters seamlessly. I am particularly interested in the following 4 parameters:

1. ball falling frequency: how many balls fall in 1 second
2. elasticity of the ball
3. distance between rows of the sticks
4. distance between sticks in the same row

Here are the urls for the external libraries:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.11.5/lib/p5.min.js
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/matter-js/0.12.0/matter.min.js

Let's break down this task to 3 steps.

1. Step 1, I want you to only write p5.js code and I am going to try it using p5.js editor so you can focus on the physics side.
2. Step 2, after step 1 is complete, turn the working code into a single HTML page. 
3. Step 4, enable interactivity of changing parameters. If you are not able to change those parameters seamlessly, it is ok if a parameter-changing action restart the simulation from scratch.

Always ask for confirmation before moving on.
